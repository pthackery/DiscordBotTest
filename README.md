# DiscordBotTest
Getting acquainted with creating a Discord bot

Simple code to demo a Discord bot with commands for having the bot track group meetings. See tutorials at bottom for full integration into Discord.
Mine is set-up on DigitalOcean server to keep bot running even when my computer is not on. 

See TODO and FIXME tags to see what is planned for future implementation.

Commands to start: 
Run 'node ./bot.js' (not on server)
Run 'pm2 start bot.js' (on server)


Code for bot is based on Renemari Padillo's tutorial:

Getting bot running on server based on Brennen Bearnes's tutorial:
